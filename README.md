# Monty-Hall-Problem
A game where you choose between three doors. One has a goat and the other two has poop. After choosing a door, you are then shown a door (not chosen) with poop. It will then ask you whether you want to keep your chose or switch to the door that isn't chosen or opened. To win, you have to choose the door that has a goat
